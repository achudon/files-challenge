	<p>Luna Lovegood is one of Harry Potter's best friends in the later part of the series of well-loved children's books by JK Rowling. Loyal and quirky, she has a knack for telling uncomfortable truths. She can often be found with a copy of <em>The Quibbler</em>, the magazine that her father publishes, which includes stories about such fantastic beasts as the Crumple-Horned Snorkack. Even though she gets a lot of backlash from it, she's not afraid to do (and wear), what she thinks is appropriate. One of her most famous accessories are her "Dirigible Plum" earrings, shown in the above picture.</p>
